# 🎨Themes 
My portfolio embraces a theme of creative elegance and modern sophistication, brought to life through a rich palette of purple shades. The use of purples—from soft lavenders to deep violets—symbolizes imagination, ambition, and individuality, reflecting both my artistic personality and professional journey. This color choice creates an atmosphere that feels both inspiring and refined, making it the perfect visual identity for a designer who values bold ideas, emotional depth, and visual harmony.

# 💡Challenges 
I didn't face particular challenges during working on my portfolio except for making it responsive for all platforms. I used modern technologies like Flex box to solve this problem. 

# ✍️Typography 
I used famouse and accessible fonts from Google fonts (Poppins & Lato) to ensure my website smoothness.
